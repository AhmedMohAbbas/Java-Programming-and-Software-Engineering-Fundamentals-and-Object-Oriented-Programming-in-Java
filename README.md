# Java-Programming-and-Software-Engineering-Fundamentals-and-Object-Oriented-Programming-in-Java
The "Java Programming and Software Engineering Fundamentals Specialization" and the "Object Oriented Programming in Java Specialization" certificates are offered on Coursera by a collaboration between DUKE university and the University of California San Diego. While some material is shared between the two courses, each has its own certificate that is awarded to those who finish the tests successfully. Together they are a greatly comprehensive way to get into JAVA and form a solid foundation in it and similar C-like languages. Especially if you already have some basic understanding of programming. You can find them here https://www.coursera.org/specializations/java-programming and here https://www.coursera.org/specializations/object-oriented-programming respectively.

# This Repository
This repository contains my own personal coursework throughout the whole Specialization. It starts small and adds up progressively to the final project which is a complete (back-end wise) CRUD web application. Therefore, there will be some code snippets carried over here and there. As well as some personal notes and sketches, feel free to ignore those :)

Some files may contain code from examples as well as some trial and error and are not 100% my own code (examples, obviously) but could be useful to look at for a new learner. However, Any “Assignment” code is my own personally written code which I used to pass the course tests. Feel free to use any of this code as you wish.

Some course work was shared between the two specializations. Each course work is available in its respective directory. As for " bonus course work ", I did not include it here as I did not do all of the extra stuff and did not like including unfinished business.
